# DAIHard

Decentralized fiat/crypto trading. See the [launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/bdetr2/daihard_the_unkillable_cryptofiat_gateway_any/) for more details.

# Building

With Elm installed, from the root folder run `npm run dev` (to play with a local version of DAIHard) or `npm run build` (to get a deployable version to upload somewhere).
